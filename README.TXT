My Discord bot will be referred to by the name: "Woody Botpecker"
It will let the user be able to play a number of text based games. They will be:
- Guess the number
- Tic-Tac-Toe
- 
The bot will also be able to store measurement data and converts it to a different unit, such as kilometers to miles or celcius to fahrenheit.
